Description:
The program will be a game called Find The Mugwumps.  The game consists of a 10x10 grid, with four
spaces randomly assigned a Mugwump.  Each turn, the player enters an X coordinate and a Y 
coordinate, from 0 to 9.  The computer then calculates the distances from each Mugwump and displays 
them to the player.  If the player guesses a space with a Mugwump, the game should reply “You have 
found this Mugwump” or similar. The player has 10 turns to find all four Mugwumps, or else they lose.
They win if they find all four Mugwumps.
